# HuffmanTree
HuffmanTree is a java class that allows for file compression and decompression. It can take a file and encode its contents in a .zip fashion and take the same file and decode it to return its contents to its original state. 

For a school project, I had to find a way to create an ADT Huffman Tree Class type that takes in a file, compresses and encrypts it, then is able to unzip and extract the same file. (A Huffman Tree is a methodology for compressing/encoding information that weighs “counts” the number of characters and assigns them a hierarchy in code where more frequently used characters get fewer bits for faster processing).
